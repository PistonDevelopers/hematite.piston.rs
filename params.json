The server side of the project is quite new and doesn't do anything yet.\r\n\r\n*   [https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite_server](repository)\r\n\r\n## Client\r\n\r\nThe client uses the [Piston](http://www.piston.rs/) and can currently render a “frozen” version of a Minecraft world: you can fly around in it but not interact. Rendering is nearing pixel perfection for blocks. Eventually, we also want to integrate it with the server to provide a real singleplayer mode.\r\n\r\n*   [https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite](repository)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
